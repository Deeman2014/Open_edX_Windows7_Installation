The Base Operating System
===============
Windows 7 Enterprise will be the base operating system onto which all other software will be installed.
The Enterprise version will be used, and not the Professional version, because Network File Sharing (NFS) services client software is required, 
and it is not included in the Windows 7 Professional.

(Windows 7 Ultimate also includes NFS, so that it could be used as well.)

-Installing Windows 7 Enterprise
----------------
Subtitles are set with '-' and are required to have the same length
of the subtitle itself, just like titles.
Lists can be unnumbered like:
 * Item Foo
 * Item Bar
Or automatically numbered:
 #. Item 1
 #. Item 2
