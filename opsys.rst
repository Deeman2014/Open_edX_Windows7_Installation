The Base Operating System
=========================
Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise will be the base operating system onto which all the other software will be installed.

The Enterprise version will be used, and not the Professional version, because Network File Sharing (NFS) Services Client for Unix software is required, 
and it is not included in the Windows 7 Professional.

(Windows 7 Ultimate also includes NFS, so that it could be used as well.)
