Introduction
===============
This section provides an introduction to installing Open edX on a single stand-alone computer.

The Goal
--------

The ultimate goal is to create a complete and working instance of Open edX on a single computer, whereby a content developer could immediately use it to develop Open edX courses.

These instructions will describe the steps necessary to install a copy of the Aspen.1 production release of Open edX on a single Windows 7 Enterprise based personal computer.


The Overall Process
-------------------

The overall installation process will involve the following major steps:
 #. Acquiring/Downloading the required software.
 #. Installing the host operating system.
 #. Installing the curl software program.
 #. Installing the Oracle Virtual Box virtualization package.
 #. Installing the Vagrant provisioning and installation package.
 #. Using Vagrant to download and install the Open edX environment.
 #. Installing several additional software utilities.
 #. Installing and configuring the mail system software.
 #. Installing and configuring the Open edX-related Stanford Custom Theme.
 
 
The Result
----------

After successfully executing the above steps, you should have a working copy of the Open edX environment on your computer, including the ability to:
 #. Login to both the Learning Management System (LMS) and to Studio, the Content Management System (CMS).
 #. Register as a new user.
 #. Sign up for a course.
 #. Create new courses and content.
 #. Access the edX content from the host operating system.
 
 All of this will be possible on your local computer.
 
 These steps will not necessarily make the courses available to anyone else, on the internet or otherwise.
 More configuration will be necessarily for that.
 
 But the courses produced could be exported and then imported into a system that is accessible on the internet.
